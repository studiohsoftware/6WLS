# 6WLS Powered Busboard
This powered busboard design features a four layer PCB with a single dedicated ground plane and EMI shielded supplies. The result is a very low noise system with unprecedented preset bus stability.
</br>
</br>
There are two versions that fit Buchla cases. A 30W version for cases 18 spaces or less, and a 40W version for 24 space cases. The only difference between them are the supplies used, and the PCB footprints to support them (the board mounting in the boat is exactly the same.) The 30W version uses the Cincon EC6C, and the 40W version uses the Cincon EC7C. These supplies can be back ordered through either mouser.com or sager.com. 
</br>
</br>
There is a 40W "OTHER" version for cases using Roman bolt spacing (SAM/BOOPS/etc.) This board also uses the Cincon EC7C.
